The following shows the stats for inputted player 'seth' against all their opponents. "Average game index" approximates how late into the season two players have played. A higher index corresponds to more recently played games. The elo used is the raw elo from the spreadsheet, not the elo from the leaderboards. A positive elo differential means seth had the higher average elo when playing against their opponent. A negative elo differential would mean the opposite. The same is true for total run differential. 


The current average index is 1296
